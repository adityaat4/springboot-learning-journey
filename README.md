# Spring Boot Learning Journey

This repository documents my ongoing learning journey with Spring Boot, focused on building a strong foundation in backend development.

The code here represents hands-on practice, experiments, and incremental improvements as I learn how real-world Spring Boot applications are structured and built.

## 📌 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into multiple modules, each covering a specific concept:

- **Spring Boot Overview**
  - Project setup
  - Application structure
  - Configuration basics

- **Spring Boot Core**
  - Dependency Injection
  - Annotations
  - Bean lifecycle

- **Spring Boot + JPA / Hibernate**
  - Entity mapping
  - CRUD operations
  - Repository layer

- **REST APIs with Spring Boot**
  - REST controllers
  - Request/Response handling
  - Exception handling

- **OpenAPI / Swagger Integration**
  - API documentation
  - Spring Data REST

- **Basic REST Security (Work in Progress)**
  - Authentication concepts
  - Securing REST endpoints

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Hibernate
- REST APIs
- OpenAPI / Swagger
- Maven
- MySQL (where applicable)

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
This repository is created to:
- Learn Spring Boot by building practical examples
